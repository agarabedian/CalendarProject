# RevBoss React Coding Project

This project was created by Aram Garabedian using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template and written in TypeScript. The project also utilizes [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) for component design.\
\
In this project, a user can view their availability calendar to see which days they are available (which is set to Monday - Friday, 9:00AM - 5:00PM by default), add new available periods, remove available periods, as well as edit existing available periods. The user can also print the list of their availabilities to the browser console.
